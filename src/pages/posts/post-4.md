Responsiveness for me is the heart of Web Development. I know starting out, I didn't do mobile first coding (you should) but I'm following the tutorial so bear with me again. 

## What I've accomplished

1. **Make reusable components**:
   
   I made reusable components to be used all throughout the website. What I did is to refactor the code. The layout is still the same but I am turning some of the codes into components so it will be more organized and cleaner to look at. Refactoring has lots of pros: my favorite is that it is easier to follow and I can just edit a part in one place rather than going back and forth in editing. 

2. **Make the site responsive**: 
  
  I made the site responsive through making a navigation component first and then make it interactive through importing a js file in all the pages. 

  Yes I can write a script specifically to the page just by writing it just before the body closing tag but why do that when you can make it easier to yourself by making it global? 

  Am i right or am i right? 
   

## What's next
