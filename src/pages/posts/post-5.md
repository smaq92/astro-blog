Whoah Astro Layout is a lot to take in. I'm just thankful I did have a backrgound in React and Laravel. It helped a lot with understanding it for sure

## What I've accomplished

1. **Make a different layout for posts**:
   
   Honestly, I'm kinda skeptical about styling .md files (I don't know why). But adding layout like this is such a fun and easy way to do it. I managed to create a different layout for the single post and it has proven to be simple but effective. 

2. **Combine the layout**: 
  
  I made the post page to be just like the rest of the site by combining the layout components. I'm gonna lie if I say slot and prop is not confusing at all. It's tricky to understand especially when layout combination is involved. 
  
   

## What's next
