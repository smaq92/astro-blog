    <p>Hey there! Here are a few facts about me</p>
    <ol>

      <li>
        I live in {identity.country} and I am an aspiring {identity.occupation}.

    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    <p>
      I do freelance work through the small start-up (CSS Creatives) I created
      with my friends: Sydney and Cherry.

    <p>
      Right now, we don't have any projects lined up yet as we're waiting for
      the go-signal from our first client.

      My mission for this year is to hopefully get a full-time employment as a
      web developer/designer at a good company for financial stability. In
      addition, i want to build a fashion clothing website for my own shop:
      Alitaya.
