## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**:
   
   The Astro blog tutorial is straight to the point and I only have to run "npm create astro@latest" to install a new project. I already have node, github and netlify so it is a breeze. 
   
   If you don't have those, just install node.js first (installing nvm is optional but it will allow you to install multiple versions of node in your computer which is helpful since frameworks often require different versions). Then install astro, create github, make a remote repo and connect it to netlify. That way, everytime you push and commit -- it will reflect on netlify. Saves you the trouble. 

2. **Making Pages**: 
  
   I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

    So far I'm loving ASTRO, it's very straightforward and I'm basically just using basic HTML right now. 

3. **Making Blog Posts**: 

   I honestly got confused with the posts. I thought I have to create the posts folder under src/ but it should be in the **pages** folder instead. 


## What's next

I will finish the Astro blog tutorial, hopefully finish the whole astro framework and build a website for a cleaning company. And move on to the next framework! 

Please stay tuned!

p.s. I created this post using MD files. I didn't even need to write some wacky code.
