I don't want to compare but this is more exciting than the other frameworks I've learned so far. Very straightforward and I'm loving this .md posts. Only thing I wonder is how to style it but that's a later me problem. 

## What I've accomplished

1. **Define Variables**:
   
   Astro lets one define variables in the frontmatter script, between the code fences ( --- ). You can then use this variables anywhere in your HTML for as many times as you want. Just make sure to put it inside "{}" in the **HTML area**. 

2. **Conditional Rendering**: 
  
  One can use the logic functions/expressions like **&&** or **>**, even tertiary operators to conditionally render messages. This is pretty useful when you want to update your audience on certain conditions. 
   

## What's next

I will start styling the pages so it looks like a more legit website.
